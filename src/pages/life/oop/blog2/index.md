1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I juggled school and work while keeping my focus on work-school-life balance. Even though I didn’t achieve as much as I hoped this week in terms of all my projects, I made sure my mental health was still intact instead of not taking breaks and burning out eventually. At least now I’m feeling relaxed and I’m currently using the weekend to catch up on my assignments.

1. **What’s in your way?**

    Honestly, I’m STILL not used to online classes. I don’t know how to fully describe it, but I seem to not be able to enjoy online classes the same way I did in-person classes. The atmosphere of a Zoom lecture makes me feel unmotivated compared to a classroom setting, I feel very isolated, and it’s too easy to get distracted — I’m on my own PC, in my own room, with my phone and nobody watching me, so my attention can easily drift away. This will be a huge problem for all my classes.

    (Also, I was going to rely on campus Macs for the iOS class, but it’s online now and I don’t own a Mac. I’m trying to find an alternative but it’s really hard, and I might end up having to go to campus or buy a Mac…unless someone knows a solution to that?)

1. **What will you do next week?**

    In addition to finishing all of my projects and getting help, I’m going to keep finding ways to prevent myself from getting distracted or spaced out during class.

    So far, my manager gave me a really good tip after I told him I had an iPad: I can watch Zoom on my iPad, somewhere outside of my apartment, to avoid the both the distractions of my PC (no such thing as splitting windows on my iPad) and the distractions of my room. I can also leave my phone behind so that distraction is gone. I did that for my iOS class, and went to the Starbucks patio on 24th. I paid full attention that time.

    Unfortunately, this tip might not even work for this class, because I need access to a computer for the Canvas quiz, as well as a good camera/mic when I get cold called. So I may have to find a separate way for this class alone.

1. **What was your experience of assertions, Google Test, and gcov?**

    I was definitely familiar with assertions thanks to my team in OS, but I haven’t had any experience yet with Google Test and gcov. Once I start using them more, I look forward to seeing how useful they’ll be in this class and my future work.

1. **How are you doing and holding up? What’s been most helpful for you in terms of support at this time?**

    Not very well, because I feel overwhelmed by everything at the moment. People are used to the online format by now, while others are still struggling to adjust. I spend nearly every hour of the day on a computer screen, for all my classes and work, and I’m feeling the need to go outside more. It’s fortunate that my CS friends moved into the same apartment complex as me, two floors up so we can visit each other, and they’re probably the one thing keeping me sane, otherwise I have barely any human interactions.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I’ve actually been catching up with Jojo (it’s a mainstream anime so you’ve probably heard of it) at a pace of 2 episodes a day, and it’s a great way to take a break between classes and work sessions. Usually I find myself getting so busy that I stop progressing on a series for weeks, but I’m finally taking enough breaks to keep going. Unfortunately it does contribute to the amount of time I spend staring at a screen, though.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    I just got my PC dual-booted with Linux this week with the help of my friend, and I would highly recommend it if you haven’t done it already. Having Ubuntu on my computer is a huge advantage for work and some of my classes. I previously used WSL 2 on Windows but it was an extreme pain to deal with some things like broken packages. Right now it feels like I’m on a lab machine at the GDC, except I’m in my apartment.
