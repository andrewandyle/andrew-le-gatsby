1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I put together my notes for the OOP exam and took the exam in two nights. I also finished the Allocator project with my partner immediately after. This has been my heaviest OOP week so far, but fortunately the workload in this class will die down for a little while.

1. **What’s in your way?**

    I always have 4 group projects going on, and it’s becoming more difficult to manage them all at once. I constantly find myself cycling between them and reporting progress for each, but I end up slipping in at least one of them. Two of them are from work, and the other two are this class and iOS. Of course, this is the only group where it’s not a long-term project (because it’s just the 4 different pair-programming projects).

1. **What will you do next week?**

    Now that my exams and project 3 are done, this week gives me a chance to catch up on my work for my other 3 groups. I don’t imagine this week will be heavy on OOP, as I’m simply keeping up with lectures, and I don’t usually start the projects until the weekend after they’re assigned (and they’re usually assigned towards the end of the week). Hoping I can find another good partner for the next project as well.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of The Liskov Substitution Principle?**

    I definitely found the article interesting, because it gave clear examples of violations of the LSP and how the behavior of derivative classes should be consistent with the behavior of the base class. It gave a lot of insight on the criteria for object-oriented design to be considered consistent, and how to prevent bad functionality to make it easier for future programming.

1. **What was your experience of Test #1?**

    I definitely struggled on the problems individually due to overthinking the problems. They were much more straightforward than I thought, which I would realize once I got to the group part of the exam. I definitely like the group part of the exam, it reduces the blow of my individual mistakes and it reassures that my thought process for some problems was correct, but it can also make me feel like an idiot when a simple oversight prevented my code from working correctly.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I went biking nearly every day this week, whether it was to campus to meet up with my friends to study, or to downtown to randomly explore different areas. This somewhat makes up for not being on campus regularly to see my friends, sit at a table, and have study sessions.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is the selection of LeetCodes that one of my friends found, and both of us have been grinding it out randomly from the list. It’s a list of top 75 LeetCodes that cover the most important core concepts and appear commonly in interviews, found on Blind: https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU
