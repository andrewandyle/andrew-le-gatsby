1. **What did you do this past week?**

    Nothing much for this class, as I’ve had to take care of multiple other projects simultaneously and prepare for interviews. I did start the Darwin project with my partner this Saturday, and we already hit the ground running.

1. **What’s in your way?**

    Nothing at the moment. I’m trying to keep up with all my work in a healthy manner, so I don’t feel too overwhelmed by everything. I have no trouble reviewing the previous lecture before attending class.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I will continue to work on the Darwin project with my partner, hopefully at the same pace of 2 hours per day. All of my projects so far have been finished in about a week, so that’s hopefully the same with this project.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of Ethical CS?**

    I haven’t read it yet. I’m not sure if I will read it with the amount of assessments and projects I have to deal with.

1. **What was your experience of lambdas, initializations, std::initializer_list, and std::vector?**

    I was already familiar with the lambda functions, but the initializer_list will take a bit of time for me to wrap my head around. It was nice to learn these and how they applied to building the vector class right after. I didn’t realize we would need to have two different versions of functions like begin/end and index, since we want to support read/write and read-only vectors.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I think I finally did good in my Citi final round interview, hopefully good enough to get an offer! I had 3 separate interviews, they were all friendly and purely behavioral, and I received some positive feedback in each. I made sure to connect with all of them on LinkedIn right after as well. Fingers crossed here, I don’t find out for up to 2 weeks though.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is [styled components](https://styled-components.com/), a CSS-in-JS styling framework for React. The web-app that I’ve been working on for my job has been transitioning from using Sass to using styled components. It gives a lot of freedom with creating custom components in React projects, allows passing props in (to avoid having different CSS classes for different conditions), and is much cleaner than using a bunch of classes throughout the code or inline styling.
