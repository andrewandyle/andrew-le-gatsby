1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I got started on the Allocator project with my partner. We met up a few times, working strictly 2 hours a day, and made progress on the allocate and deallocate functions. Though we’re not at quite a fast pace right now, we’re in midterm weeks and still have plenty of time to finish this after the upcoming OOP exam.

1. **What’s in your way?**

    All of my midterms and work/project deadlines are starting to crush me. It’s like if I take the time to breathe for even a moment, I will fall behind on something. But if I don’t breathe, I will fall behind anyway. It feels like a lose-lose situation that I just have to push through.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I will continue working with my partner, 2 hours a day, on the Allocator project, except for Tuesday-Thursday, around the time of the exam. For the exam, I’ll put all my written notes into a different format so I’ll have a better memory, and can more easily search through my notes. I’m thinking of making a private GitHub repo so I can use markdown on my notes. One of my friends does this for all of his CS classes and his notes are very well-organized.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of The Open-Closed Principle?**

    I thought the open-closed principle was a great approach to object-oriented design and should be applied whenever necessary on scalable projects. It seems like quite a difficult practice to adapt to, but very effective once you master it. I thought the examples effectively outlined the differences and improvements when conforming to this principle.

1. **What was your experience of iterator concepts, std::array, and std::vector?**

    A lot of this week’s material felt like an expansion of the iterator and list concepts that I previously worked with in Java. I’m interested in how much variation there is with iterators in C++, and learning about which structures to use over others.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I spent Saturday doing absolutely nothing. Absolutely. Nothing. No assignments or work, and not even gaming, watching anything, or going out with friends. Just chilling on my bed and doing nothing. For the first time in probably two months. I might regret it a bit, but it felt refreshing after last week pretty much killed me.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week would be to connect with recruiters and interviewers via LinkedIn the moment you talk to them. Normally I would send follow-up emails, sometimes with questions about the company, and at the very least just thanking them for their time. There are plenty of times where I don’t get their emails though. If you manage to get their full name (which is easier when talking to them remotely), then find them and connect so you could also message them questions!
