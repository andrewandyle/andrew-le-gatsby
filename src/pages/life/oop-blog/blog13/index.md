1. **What did you do this past week?**

    My partner and I wrapped up the Life project. It seems like we overestimated this project, and after going through a tough time with the Darwin project, we breezed through this one. Having previous experience with inheritance helped a lot, as well as using office hours immediately when running into C++ class errors.

1. **What's in your way?**

    With the OOP projects done and nearly every project wrapped up for all classes (just need to take care of Modern Web Apps), I have to begin studying for my exams. I don't have finals, only last exams just like this class. I thought this exam would be Monday, December 7th, but it got pushed forward to the 3rd and 4th, landing on the same day as my MWA exam on Friday. Really sucks to get overwhelmed on that one day, but that day is now the end of my semester!

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I will finish my one remaining assignment over the weekend, then continue to grind out for work until I go home on Wednesday, since I've put a lot more emphasis on school than work lately. Then I will relax for Thanksgiving, and then use the weekend to study for my exams and do the HackerRanks for this class.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You?**

    The paper's topic of community awareness regarding these ethical and behavioral issues in the workplace (sexism, harassment, racism) is important to keep in mind. It's easy to forget due to the benefits of pursuing a career in computer science that these types of experiences exist among others and could drive them out of the field.

1. **What was your experience of inheritance?**

    It felt like a refresher from learning inheritance from Java, but with the added complications of using pointers with parent/child classes in C++. Inheritance is such an important topic for object-oriented development that I can often get confused on, but I found the concepts this week to be very clear!

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I started off the week feeling overwhelmed because of all my due dates landing at both the middle of this week and the beginning of next week. But I went really hard on one assignment at a time, rather than trying to split up my hours on each of them per day. This seemed to work well, because I've cleared up all but one of my school deadlines before the weekend hit. I'm happy and relieved that this week went better than I thought it would in terms of productivity.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is [CodePath](https://codepath.org/classes), a nonprofit that offers free remote courses for CS students. I took one of their courses for Android last fall, and it was my first exposure to mobile development. They mostly do mobile development, cybersecurity, and technical interview courses (usually over the summer), so I feel like they're good to have on top of your university courses. At least in my Android class, the content was well-paced and clear, the workload was light, and the projects went on my GitHub. The course was something I could add on to my portfolio. (I even have a [page](https://andrewandyle.github.io/codepath.html) on my old website covering some of what I've learned!)
