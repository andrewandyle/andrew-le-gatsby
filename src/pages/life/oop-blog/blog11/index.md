1. **What did you do this past week?**

    My partner and I wrapped up the Darwin project and passed all the HackerRank test cases. After submitting the project, I got slammed on by the workload for my iOS team's Beta Release, but I managed to get that finished too. I seem to have gotten better at juggling multiple projects, as I've made an effort to distribute all my school/work hours evenly throughout the day instead of working 8amâ€“5pm with only an hour of break, then losing motivation. This way, I could even work from 8am all the way up to midnight without tiring out.

1. **What's in your way?**

    The Darwin project took way longer than expected. It was already time-consuming figuring out what kind of design for our classes would be considered good, and we constantly changed our implementation to avoid the use of getters/setters. Then there was figuring out our optimization, which we barely managed to figure out before deciding to give up on the last case. We based our expected finish time off of how we did on the previous projects, but then our actual finish time was over double those hours.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I plan on securing a partner for Project 5 and immediately getting to work on it. If the Darwin project was already tough enough to have my partner and I invest way more time than expected and use office hours a lot, then I'd rather not underestimate this one too. I hope I can keep up a consistent work schedule with my next partner as usual, working 2 hours a day (and ramping it up when the deadline approaches) and making the most of them through constant discussion.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of The Dependency Inversion Principle?**

    I found it really interesting and liked how clear and concise the explanations were for the benefits of using abstract classes. Though this is something most CS students likely get taught early on, this article offered great and simple examples of how not using abstract classes can lead to any of the traits that consider a software design to be bad.

1. **What was your experience of continuing to implement std::vector, move semantics, and allocators again?**

    These concepts were brand new to me, and took me a bit of time to grasp them so I struggled when immediately going into the HackerRanks. Implementing move semantics and allocators address important efficiency issues for vectors, such as preventing unnecessary copies when taking in an r-value, as well as the O(n) fill operation upon every vector construction regardless of the data type.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I thought I finally deserved to treat myself after such a heavy project deadline week. I looked up food recommendations and tried two new restaurants back-to-back: Bar Peached on W 6th St, and Lucky Robot on S Congress Ave (in South River City). I tried their most popular dishes which I saw before deciding on those places, and they were amazing and definitely worth it. They're also quite expensive though, but I haven't spent much money on eating out since COVID.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is this article that covers a [work model](https://theleanway.net/muda-mura-muri) (known as the Toyota 3M model) that aims to eliminate workflow inefficiency by looking at 3 issues: Muda (waste), Mura (unevenness), and Muri (overburden). My scrum team focuses on this, and every time we do a sprint reflection, we try to identify any instances of these 3 that happened throughout the sprint, and come up with solutions to apply to our next sprint in the form of kaizen (continuous improvement).
