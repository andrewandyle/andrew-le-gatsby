* **Where did you grow up?**

    I spent my whole life in San Antonio, TX, before moving to Austin for college.

* **What high school did you attend?**

    Health Careers High School. I didn't know what I wanted to major in during most of my high school years, and didn't expect to commit to a CS path early on.

* **What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**

    Piano! I performed plenty of times at talent shows with my best friend.

* **Why did you come to UT?**

    Definitely because of the reputation and prestige of the CS program here.

* **Why are you majoring in CS?**

    CS has a lot of potential, is high in demand, and can be applied to pretty much any other field. I don't know exactly where I want to apply my CS skills when I graduate yet, but I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and discover what path I want to take with CS.

* **Why are you in this class?**

    OOP is a highly valued skill in industry, and learning more about these practices would greatly benefit me in my coming internships and full-time jobs.

* **How did you feel about the cold calling?**

    Nobody ever says anything bad about the cold calling. Just that the words "cold calling" always sound scary in any class, so people have to remind us that it's not supposed to be scary in this class. It might be really necessary for me to keep myself engaged with this class. Being online is not my ideal situation, it feels very discouraging to stare at a Zoom lecture and get easily distracted or spaced out, so this gives me a reason to pay attention.

* **What made you happy this week?**

    I finished what was basically a 2-week hackathon at my full-time internship, which has just come to an end, so I'm reverting back to part-time. I just sat at my PC, endlessly coding frontend in React Native and communicating with my manager, with almost no breaks, for 14 days straight. It was very intense and I pushed through to get a lot done, but my manager was impressed by my pace, considering I didn't know the codebase at all or have worked on a React Native project before. So I'm glad I delivered on my results, and finally have room to breathe!
