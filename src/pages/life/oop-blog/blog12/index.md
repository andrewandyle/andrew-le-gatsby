1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I got started on the Life project with my partner. So far, we seem to be smooth sailing, and it really helps that we already had experience working on the Darwin project. At the moment, we've set up the 5 classes and we have to connect it to the I/O to see if they work. Hopefully this project won't have us as stuck as Darwin.

1. **What's in your way?**

    Work is ramping up, as I have to deal with sprint/milestone deadlines and stay on schedule for work, as well as prepare for both an exam and iOS presentation next week. I need to go hard on all of my deadlines next week, because once Thanksgiving week hits and I go back home to my family, it will be super difficult to stay on pace!

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I will once again have to balance all of my tasks, while putting priority on what's due first. I am hoping to get the Life project done with my partner before next weekend hits. Though that's not as urgent as my other school deadlines, it would be nice to get OOP out of the way so I can relax a bit more on the same week as Thanksgiving Break.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of The New Methodology?**

    As someone who uses Agile methodologies every day at work (usually scrum), I really liked this article because it effectively compared traditional methodologies to Agile by describing the differences between predictive and adaptive approaches, and clearly outlined the difficulties that can occur with following traditional methodologies.

1. **What was your experience of containers, container adapters, and Life?**

    I felt that this week's concepts were easier to grasp, probably because the containers we went over should be familiar from Data Structures. But I found it interesting when comparing the best choices for underlying containers for each of them, basing them off of factors such as indexing and resizing. It felt like the iterators topic again, when we would decide on what strength of iterator we would need.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I just signed an internship offer with Citi! I'm super excited for next summer!!!

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based framework that makes starting a website easier. There are lots of quick tutorials on it, so even people without much experience coding up websites could use it. I've seen it recommended a lot of times online, as well as a couple of times at UTCS events. I will finally give it a shot and replace my personal website by making a new portfolio using Gatsby. (I made this blog post on my old website)

    I made my old website back when I lacked exprience with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to use something like Gatsby that sets up most of the front-end for you. I think making a basic website was a great learning curve, but I think it's finally time for me to abandon it. I'll also move all my blogs over to my new site.
