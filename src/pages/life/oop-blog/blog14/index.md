* **How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?**
  * test first, test during, test after, test, test, test
  * when designing algorithms, demand the weakest iterators (e.g. bidirectional vs. random access)
  * when designing containers, provide the strongest iterators (e.g. random access vs bidirectional)
  * build adapters on top of containers, iterators, and functions
  * always look for reuse and symmetry in your code
  * collaboration is essential to the quality of your code and to your well-being in producing it
  * refactor, refactor, refactor
  * make your code beautiful
    
    Each topic in this course had a lot of cases and examples that laid a solid foundation for me for C++. For the iterator and container concepts, I really liked how we referred to Java a lot to compare and contrast structures between that and C++, which really helped in showing how thorough the C++ library is: there were many examples on inefficient actions that compile in Java but not in C++. I also found the examples of reusing code and symmetry to be very helpful, and I learned structures and keywords that were unfamiliar to me but have utility that I never thought about before.

    I felt like I gained a ton from the projects in terms of testing, refactoring, and making beautiful code, when discussing the projects in lecture and office hours, and when doing the projects with partners. Having many collaborative elements in this course has allowed me to exchange ideas back and forth with other students.

* **Were there any other particular takaways for you?**

    I really liked reading the articles going over object-oriented design principles. They felt so concise and to the point when proving their principles through examples. I feel like I even started applying them at my current job, and I've gotten much better following these paradigms with JavaScript code when doing refactors throughout the codebase.

* **How did you feel about two-stage quizzes and tests?**

    The majority of quizzes being two-step didn't feel necessary when everyone aced them. It was usually submitting the same answers, and one of us asking about a question we got wrong, then silence for the remaining time. (But hey, it was nice to bump up the non-perfect scores anyway, so I can't complain about that)

    I definitely liked the two-step tests. I think the collaborative parts of the exams allowed much more room for thinking, because 4 other students being able to watch for small errors ensured that little time was wasted debugging. That's what always kills me when taking HackerRanks individually, I lose time to think through and reach the solution because of debugging.

* **How did you feel about cold calling?**

    Cold calling was very necessary for me to stay on my toes in this class. The other classes felt like an empty void when attending the lectures that I stopped attending them completely and went asynchronous. Cold calling made this class feel more like a class than my other ones this semester.

* **How did you feel about office hours?**

    Office hours were an extremely helpful resource to unblock me and my partners from implementation and optimization issues. For me, not a single one went to waste, as I was always able to break through the problem with the help of Professor Downing and the TAs. I made sure to only attend them when I was totally stuck, and prepare to explain my implementation well enough to identify a hint at the problem. Scheduling pair programming meetings right before they occur also helped tremendously.

* **How did you feel about lab sessions?**

    I've only been to lab sessions twice, since I mostly took advantage of office hours, but a student had answered my question both times I was there! I'm really glad this class was full of students willing to help each other, through both this and Piazza.

* **Give me your suggestions for improving the course.**

    I can't even think of something to suggest after a lot of time thinking it through. The workload feels just right, nothing stood out as extremely difficult (and even if it did, the network of students would help a lot), and there were so many incentives (extra credit, dropped assignments) that I always felt fine and never stressed out in this course. But you still have to put in the effort, so it felt like a balanced course. A balanced, yet generous course.
