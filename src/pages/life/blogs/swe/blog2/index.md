1. **What did you do this past week?**

   Nothing of note for this class, since this week is the same as the second week of OOP.

   On the topic of software engineering, I'm participating in a Citi hackathon from Friday to Monday. I'm coding a web-app from scratch with two of my friends using React and AWS. This is the first time I've configured an AWS backend from scratch (as opposed to working with an existing backend for my job), but I found the process to be easy and would recommend trying it to whichever group I get for this class.

1. **What's in your way?**

   My lack of time due to both work and the Citi hackathon is making me slip behind in schoolwork.

1. **What will you do next week?**

   I will rewatch all lectures for my classes to stay on top of the material, and knock out Collatz as quickly as possible. Hopefully that goes smoothly due to already doing it in OOP.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the makefile?**

   It was a good refresher of what I had to deal with for every OOP project, since we've had to modify it on every project (especially the last one, which was more painful). But since the SWE project format is different, as we're creating dynamic web-apps in groups, I'm not sure if we have to deal with modifying the makefile as often.

1. **What was your experience of Docker?**

   I liked using Docker last semester in OOP, and it was simple to set up. It's convenient for these classes to provide a container so I don't need to install a bunch of new tools on my machine.

1. **What was your experience of assertions?**

   Assertions are a good practice to utilize in programming to strictly define the required preconditions and postconditions for functions. However, I didn't find many instances in the later OOP projects where I needed to use assertions outside of my run harness. So I don't quite have a strict habit of using them myself.

1. **What was your experience of unit tests?**

   I still haven't used unit tests outside of this class and OOP. I don't know how useful it would be to integrate unit test frameworks into my jobs, since I'm mostly dealing with frontend component errors rather than code logic. The 20+ unit test requirement for the projects may have been a hassle, but there have been a few cases where they helped me quickly identify bugs in my code.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

   I purchased a Persona 5-style portrait as a commission which took a couple of days, and I'm absolutely in love with it! I've put it on my [landing page](https://aale.dev/) and replaced all my profile pictures.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   My tip-of-the-week is to watch videos from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb). He offers several crash courses on web technologies, and I've found his courses very effective when first starting off on web development, as well as picking up on new technologies. I used his tutorials to create [my first personal website](https://github.com/andrewandyle/andrewandyle.github.io) using HTML, CSS, and JS, and I also used his Gatsby tutorial to code this current website! I recently watched his Angular tutorial to prepare for my Citi internship, which uses Angular instead of React.
