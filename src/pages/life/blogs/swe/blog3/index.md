1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I mostly had to deal with work from other classes, especially algos which was time-consuming, so I didn't invest that much time in this class. It helps that I can take it easy while the curriculum is the same as OOP at the beginning though.

1. **What's in your way?**

    I'm still behind in my classes due to losing all of last weekend to a hackathon. Now I have to spend this weekend catching up on all of my classes by rewatching the past lecture recordings.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I plan on prioritizing finishing Collatz before moving on to the rest of my classes. I've only started a little bit of Collatz so far, but I don't imagine it will be too hard to catch up. I'm wondering if I have to make more optimizations than my C++ solution if I can't meet the runtime requirements with Python.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Continuous Integration?**

    This is something I read in OOP last semester, but I liked reading it again. This seems like an article that would come in handy to people that are new to development teams, since I only began following most of this article after I got my first internship last summer.

1. **What was your experience of Collatz?**

    Nothing much to say here. The content this week was the exact same as in OOP, but it was a good refresher on the caching optimizations.

1. **What was your experience of exceptions?**

    Exceptions are something that I should utilize more in my projects. I don't find many cases where I need it, so I don't have the habit of using them. Funny thing is, immediately after today's exceptions lecture, I had a meeting with my manager and he was showing me areas in my code where I should be using try/catch with the finally block, which I've never thought of using before.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I'm glad that I got to relax more and get online with friends after a grind-heavy weekend. I'm also happy that I have another project to put on my resume, even if I didn't finish the app or win the hackathon.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is to get familiar with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). I was first exposed to AWS through my first internship, but the hackathon last weekend was the first time I ever built an app from scratch with AWS. There are plenty of tutorials out there on how to get started with it, and setting up a backend and authentication system (using services such as Amplify, AppSync, Cognito, DynamoDB) is really easy with just a few commands. There are other useful tools such as cloud infrastructure (EC2) and serverless functions (Lambda). If you put plenty of time into using it, setting up the boilerplate of a new app could take just a couple of hours. Also, it's really good to show off as a skill and is valuable in industry!
