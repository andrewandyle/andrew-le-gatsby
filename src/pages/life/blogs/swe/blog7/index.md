1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I met up with my group multiple times, spending the majority of this week on developing Phase I. We built out the initial React components to reuse throughout the app, and added the dummy data to pass into them. We continued to communicate on Teams for debugging, and spent a meeting on the other requirements: user stories, API documentation, technical report, and deployment. We were cutting it close on the deadline due to the difficulty of meeting up early.

1. **What's in your way?**

    No one else in my group has much React experience. I only recently gained a lot of React experience after getting my first development job last year, so I'm not super proficient at it yet (not to the point where I have a deep understanding and can effectively teach it to others). My group members have already asked me a lot of questions during our development meetings to try to understand it. I'm trying to stay at a pace so that everyone can stay on the same page and nobody gets lost, and that definitely requires exercising lots of patience.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I'm going to have to catch up on my other classes, as I've fallen behind on them since the Phase I deadline was way more urgent this week. I'm not sure if I'll be doing any Phase II work with my group, but that may depend on when the deadline for that is.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Open-Closed Principle?**

    I liked the clear examples this article provided using inheritance, to show what it meant to extend a class rather than directly modify it. I noticed it confuses a lot of people when they first read it: how can you just create code and then never modify it again? It does sound extreme to say that the code shouldn't be modified, but it mostly applies to code that will affect many other parts of the codebase, and we want to reduce these dependencies as much as possible. Once again, identifying when this principle should be applied is challenging, as it requires considerable thought on the design.

1. **What was your experience of iterators and reduce2?**

    I haven't used iterators in Python yet, but I found the differences between Python iterators and Java iterators interesting. Python iterators seem much more usable, having the ability to use a for loop on an iterator. This made the reduce2 solution pretty simple to implement.
    
    In my Java projects from Data Structures, I remember always needing to use iterators with while loops and `hasNext()`, and I remember having to resolve errors a lot since I kept using them incorrectly.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    Both of my best friends from San Antonio had their birthdays back-to-back (March 3 and March 4), so I was able to wish them happy birthday. I didn't get to go back to San Antonio to visit them due to how busy I was (and there's not as much to do nowadays due to COVID), but I'm glad they both had a great time.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is to use the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) extension if you're developing your project in VSCode. Prettier is a code formatter that enforces a consistent style based on what language you're using, so it will indent everything correctly, wrap any lines that are too long, and automatically add commas or semicolons wherever needed in JavaScript. Most of us have different coding/syntax preferences, and it's hard for code between 5 people to remain consistent, especially for newer developers. Using Prettier can fix that by making all of the code consistent and readable.
