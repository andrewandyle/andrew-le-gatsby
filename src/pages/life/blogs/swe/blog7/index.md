1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I barely caught up on my other classes in time. Both work and SWE had exhausted me last week to the point where I didn't feel like doing anything at the beginning of this week. I met up with my group once to discuss working in parallel for Phase II, since we had many conflicts this week, and we can't do all our work in just the group meetings like last phase.

1. **What's in your way?**

    Spending spring break at home will mean both distractions from my parents and losing my best work environment. I would much rather work on Ubuntu on my PC with two monitors than use WSL on my laptop. I don't think I'll get much work done for anything over spring break.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    If I can't get much work done, then I might as well try to relax. But I'm hoping I can at least go out sometimes instead of staying home all week.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Liskov Substitution Principle?**

    I remember this being one of the more confusing readings, and I had to read it over to really try and comprehend it. It's a really good principle to follow when dealing with abstraction, since it deals with consistent behavior across derivative classes of a base class, and it conforms to the Open-Closed Principle.

1. **What was your experience of iteration, comprehendions, generators, and digits iterator?**

    I haven't learned any of this content for Python, so I'm curious as to when I'll apply these concepts when programming. I've never heard of generators before, not even an equivalent to them in other languages (unless I've actually worked with them unknowingly), and it will probably take a while for me to grasp the utility of them and how they're useful. I've also never really thought about comparing the properties of iterators and containers like in class this week. The digits iterator was pretty simple.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    Algos with Fraij is my main source of stress and has 3/4 of my exams this semester (the other being network security), but I just got a 38/40 on the first exam. While I'm in a good spot, I can't afford to get cocky.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    One of the TAs (Alvin) during lab hours had just recommended using [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for this project phase when creating our MySQL database and populating it. I've looked into it and it seems very useful! It's a database IDE that makes navigating MySQL databases and code and executing queries much easier. I always used MariaDB on Ubuntu, and working with MySQL on Windows is painful, so I can't wait to try this out for the project.
