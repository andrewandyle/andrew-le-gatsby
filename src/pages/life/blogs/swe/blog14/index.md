* **How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?**
  * test first, test during, test after, test, test, test
  * when designing algorithms, demand the weakest capabilities (e.g. iterable vs. indexable)
  * when designing containers, provide the strongest capabilities (e.g. indexable vs iterable)
  * build decorators on top of containers, iterators, and functions
  * utilize the benefits of being lazy (i.e. yield)
  * always look for reuse and symmetry in your code
  * collaboration is essential to the quality of your code and to your well-being in producing it
  * refactor, refactor, refactor
  * make your code beautiful
    
    Downing conveyed these concepts very well once again, and I was able to enhance my knowledge of Java, Python and SQL. The problem is that we didn't get many opportunities in this class to actually design classes (containers and decorators) outside of the HackerRank exercises. We didn't actually use most of these concepts in the group project because there was an intentional disconnect, and I didn't know exactly where these would apply in full stack development. I took away the most from collaboration through the group project, as it was critical to us succeeding as a team and I couldn't have made it alone.

* **Were there any other particular takeaways for you?**

    I led my team during the entire project, doing everything I could to cover my teammates' lack of experience in parts of the project, and tried to constantly engage with them despite the difficulties of remote communication. I had to learn to become more understanding of my teammates, as I was a strict leader, expected too much out of them often, and blamed myself often. I've grown a lot in interacting with others in a team environment and think this experience will definitely carry over in my career.

* **How did you feel about cold calling?**

    Once again, the cold calling was a necessary incentive for me to pay attention in class even in the online environment (besides the exercises, of course). But there were twice as many students as when I took OOP, so I hardly had to think about getting cold called, as there were only 2 cycles this time.

* **How did you feel about office hours?**

    I ran into so much trouble for the group project that I abused office hours this time. Sometimes the issues were so troublesome that I would actually spend ALL of office hours (sorry to the TAs!) on the same problem and still not have it solved by then, only to figure it out shortly after. They always helped, always pushing forward my thought process, and introducing a lot of new libraries and software for me to use! (DataGrip, SQLAlchemy, and Algolia were all suggested to me by TAs)

* **How did you feel about lab sessions?**

    Just like office hours, I would abuse lab hours, and sometimes even take up the entire two hours. A teammate and I would often go to these together for backend configuration, since we had a lot of trouble setting up our models and deploying using AWS.

* **What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?**

    I learned even more this semester about how useful **Docker** is, though I'm still not proficient at using it as another one of my teammates was handling Docker-related tasks. I was introduced to Docker last semester in OOP, but it was really only used for Downing to provide us tools for C++ that we used in every project. Now, Docker is used to package our web application's libraries and dependencies to make it easier for us to deploy it on AWS. I hope I get more opportunities to use it so I can understand the deployment process in the future. (Maybe I'll crash course it?)

* **What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?**

    Using **Algolia** spared us the need to implement searching using our endpoints or database, and it was actually better suited to our requirements for making a site-wide search (and making all searches "Google-like" by using the separate search page rather than show a subset of a table). The service only required us to submit our data to our Algolia account and configure options, while we use components provided by their React library to have searching done for us! For a time-constrained project, I would definitely recommend this for easy searching in the future.

* **How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?**

    It was pure pain. We definitely did grow a lot out of it, and documentations and TAs were an invaluable resource when it came to React, Python, and SQL. However, self-teaching AWS deployment was pure agony. It was the source of most of our problems, and we still don't know how to prevent some errors to this day because in the end, all we needed was for our site to be successfully deployed. I wish I had found better resources for AWS or had a better foundation of it so I could teach my team better.

* **Give me your suggestions for improving the course.**

    My biggest suggestion would be to improve the documentation of the projects. Sometimes requirements weren't very clear, and we would have to clarify with TAs a lot or we would lose points. When looking at the other groups' RFPs, it seems people didn't fall exactly in line with the model requirements which confused us. Maybe provide examples with movie-related models? (this project IS based off of IMDb, and that subject is off-limits anyway)

    Having in-class exercises instead of exams definitely made the class less stressful overall, but it depends on everyone paying full attention and picking up on what was just taught (because I used to be able to watch lecture recordings to catch up, but that no longer helped here). Plus, people who would already have 10 exercises would have less incentive to try. After hearing complaints from my friends about that, I backed off from exercises. I'm hoping if Downing continues doing exercises, that the experience is better in-person.

    The disconnection between lectures and the project is quite troublesome, but I don't know what to suggest when this seemed to have worked out for several semesters. But it was definitely a struggle keeping up in class when the project was the most time-consuming. Also, the papers were repeats of the ones in OOP, and it felt like the papers were more suited for OOP than SWE. The course material wasn't my primary focus.

    There's a good chance that some or all of a team doesn't know React, making things incredibly difficult. I sent a crash course for my entire team to watch. One thing I could think of is having more support for the project (aside from lab hours), like having outside sessions or workshops dedicated to a part of the project, like a React session. So they're like hackathon workshops, as well as the sessions 429/439 provided on C and pointers.
