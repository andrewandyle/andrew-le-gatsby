1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I finished editing the SWE presentation on Sony Vegas last weekend. This allowed me to fully prioritize my other 3 classes all week since I'm basically set for this one. I also finished my video presentation for my music class, also using Sony Vegas. The only things I have remaining are a lab and exam for network security and an exam for algos.

2. **What's in your way?**

    Nothing's in my way for this class. My lack of motivation is in the way for my other two CS classes, especially algos. I have an entire week to catch up on lectures before I take those exams back-to-back. I just want them done already.

3. **What will you do next week?**

    I will show my presentation video next Monday, and I will continue to put in my final efforts into my other two CS classes. My semester is done once those exams are over.

4. **If you read it, what did you think of the Joel Test?**

    I didn't read this week's paper, as I spent most of my time on Phase 4 and then catching up or working on projects for my other classes.

5. **What was your experience of ___?**

    I didn't attend class this week. Last two HackerRanks I had were cutting it close, since my attention span is definitely shorter when I know I'm safe due to the grade drops. So I decided I'm better off not dragging others who need the exercise grades down.

6. **What made you happy this week?**

    I'm happy that I finished my group's presentation over a week early, and I'm proud of the way it turned out. I'm actually looking forward to showing it to others.
  
    Overall, I've gained a lot of value out of this team experience for SWE, but it did also crush my health, so I'm also really glad that it's over.

7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). It's a great online tool to make visuals and flowcharts. I like seeing software architecture diagrams, especially since it helps me understand how AWS components connect with each other. I realized that my current company had a diagram of their architecture using this tool, so I decided to build the same thing for our SWE project.
