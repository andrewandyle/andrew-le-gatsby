1. **Where did you grow up?**

    I spent my whole life in San Antonio, TX, before moving to Austin for college.

1. **What high school did you attend?**

    Health Careers High School. I didn't know what I wanted to major in during most of my high school years, and didn't expect to commit to a CS path early on.

1. **What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**

    Piano! I performed plenty of times at talent shows with my best friend.

1. **Why did you come to UT?**

    Definitely because of the reputation and prestige of the CS program here.

1. **Why are you majoring in CS?**

    CS has a lot of potential, is high in demand, and can be applied to pretty much any other field. I don't know exactly where I want to apply my CS skills when I graduate yet, but I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and discover what path I want to take with CS.

1. **Why are you in this class?**

    I was in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) last semester with Downing, and it was easily one of my favorite CS classes I've taken at UT so far. Additionally, all of my work experience so far has been software engineering, which seems to be my field of choice. I'm sure that I'll take a lot from this class and apply it to my future jobs. I also like working in dev teams, so I'm looking forward to the group work here.

1. **What are your expectations of this class?**

    I expect that the knowledge I gain from this class will enhance my software engineering skills, and introduce new and improve existing practices (refactoring, design patterns). Also hoping that the group project will become a killer project to go on all our resumes.

    I am a bit concerned that we don't get to choose our groups. Seems like all my classes this semester just now decided to start randomizing the groups. I've had a history with working with people with less motivation than me, and I haven't quite dealt with it in the best way. Depending on how the group experience goes, maybe I'll take away some key lessons regarding that too, so there's my silver lining.

1. **How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know?**

    I've become proficient at using JavaScript thanks to using React in all of my work experience last year, as well as my Modern Web Apps class last semester (all projects in Python, and last two projects in SQL and JavaScript). My work experience is primarily building web-apps using React and Redux, and using backend services (Express, AWS) and query languages (GraphQL, MySQL), so my web programming skills are solid.

1. **How did you like the two lectures?**

    Structure was very similar to the first two OOP lectures, but this time Docker is set up with Python tools.

1. **How did you feel about the cold calling?**

    Experienced cold calling last semester in OOP. Without cold calling, it'll be impossible for me to pay attention in online classes. I'm already bad at paying attention in live lectures and *always* rewatch the lecture recordings.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I'm playing multiple RPGs and watching anime (just finished Death Note today) every day. I never did this last semester, since I had 3 heavy project-based CS courses, 2 jobs, AND I was trying my hardest for recruitment. With an internship already secure for the summer, and one of my jobs ending in around a week, I'm really letting loose and trying to relax this semester. So I'm feeling much better mentally. (Even though I have algos this semester... hah...)

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a query language and server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system. You can request the specific data you want back in GraphQL queries. I learned how to use this in my first internship, and I highly recommend it when building data-driven and scalable web applications, especially if you're using AWS (their services work REALLY well with it!). All of my blog posts on this Gatsby website were generated using GraphQL as well!
