1. **What did you do this past week?**

   I started and finished Collatz last Saturday. I struggled on it more than I was hoping to, since in OOP I surprisingly got the lazy cache solution working in C++, and of course the same thing wouldn't work in Python. I couldn't get the eager cache implementation working either. I had no choice but to implement the meta cache solution. The acceptance tests on the public test repo helped me debug when I failed the HackerRanks (since they don't have any error logs), so they saved my time. The project reminded me that I still have to adapt to Python every time I switch to that after using JavaScript so frequently.

1. **What's in your way?**

   I have to keep putting in a ton of work just to stay ahead in my classes and job, so I'm feeling overwhelmed. I underestimated my Intro to Western Music class. I took it because people said it was an easy blowoff, so that's the last class I was expecting to stress me out right now.

1. **What will you do next week?**

   I need to temporarily put in more hours than usual so I can stay at least one week ahead in all my classes, so I'm not as stressed. Especially in algos, I'm doing a bad job in there so far if I keep going hard on the assignments the day they're due. Well, there's going to be insane weather all next week due to the winter storm, so if I'm stuck indoors, that might help me accomplish more.

   Also, hoping I can communicate with my team and agree on a good idea for this upcoming group project.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Pair Programming?**

   After reading this for the third time, I definitely agree with all the points brought up in this reading, but I wish that they were easier for me to follow in reality. Pair programming is definitely an efficient process when done correctly, because the two programmers become a unified force to think through and solve problems. However, in my usual case of pair programming, someone may get left in the dust. I have to learn to be more open in terms of communication and expectations, and every pair/group project is an opportunity to improve that.

1. **What was your experience of types?**

   I don't use Python nearly as much as Java and JavaScript, so this week's lectures actually revealed a lot of things I didn't know about Python. I learned things such as how ints work under the hood (changing from the value to a reference when greater than 256), booleans always being a reference to two singleton objects, and the different cases of `is` (identity comparison) with mutable and immutable data structures, just to name a few. I thought this week would just be a refresher on Python, but I took away a lot more than expected.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

   My favorite game franchise, Persona 5, has a new game coming out (Persona 5 Strikers) on Steam. I purchased the digital deluxe edition that grants 4 days early access, so I get to play it next Friday. Another incentive to get ahead in my classes. I also just gifted the deluxe edition to my best friend.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   My tip-of-the-week is to use `git commit -am <message>` command to skip the `git add .` command. I do this a lot when committing to GitHub or GitLab, and people I'm programming with don't usually know about this and get surprised. Just a small tip to save a bit of time when committing frequently. (NOTE: This only works with tracked files, so if you have any untracked files, you have to add then commit.)
