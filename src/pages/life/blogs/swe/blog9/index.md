1. **What did you do this past week?**

    Phase 2 was and continues to be my main objective throughout the entire week. I'm pulling out all the stops just to make up for our lack of progress, and suffered greatly after making strides in an all-nighter. Since we split into frontend and backend teams, I'm on the backend team, and I spent this week dealing with lots of difficulties setting up and connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

1. **What's in your way?**

    There are many things my team has to improve on. Unfortunately, I was the most familiar with React and AWS when starting off with the team, and there's a lot of things in this phase that none of my team and I knew or understood. It's become a huge grind for knowledge, and we kept running into bug after bug and going to office/lab hours. I also don't know what to do about the lack of communication sometimes, both on Teams and during full group Zoom meetings, but that's likely caused by the lack of knowledge. I will do whatever it takes next phase to increase productivity and communication, and for the entire team to be on the same page.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    Immediately after I finish with Phase 2, I will suffer hardcore from my TLS lab in Network Security. I'm really behind in that class, and my friend keeps telling me that the TLS lab is on the level of an OS lab. I should have set aside some time for that, because labs in that class are pass-fail: if you don't pass all test cases, you get a zero. And it's 12% of your grade.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Interface Segregation Principle?**

    This reading explained the most common problems people need to watch out for when designing interfaces, even tying back to several of the principles that we learned before. It did a great job showing the consequences of designing "fat" interfaces, as well as some solutions to conform to this principle, especially multiple inheritance.

1. **What was your experience of comprehensions, yield, closures, and decorators?**

    Once again, these are all new to me in Python, and I'm curious as to when I would utilize them. This week's map HackerRank was a good, simple example of when to use yields.
    
    (I'm also not sharp at using any of these yet, as I'm slipping behind in class and no longer getting good quiz grades due to having to worry about the project.)

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    After pushing through as hard as I could all week and still having no hope, the extension on Phase 2 saved me just for today. I have a little bit of hope now.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is to try obtaining the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. Over spring break, I watched a really good [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE) from freeCodeCamp.org. After completing this video, I wish I knew a lot of these services before starting this SWE project, because now I've finally gained a high-level understanding of how a lot of the AWS services work and what they're used for. It's way better than blindly following tutorials and not knowing how each service fits into the overall project. I had no idea how to explain any of what I was doing to my team.

    Though it is mentioned in this video that this certification doesn't do much good for developers. This certification benefits people in sales and management the most, since they can inform their CEOs about reasons to utilize AWS. I think some of the superficial knowledge helps though when it comes to making decisions in project teams, like choosing what services are the most cost-effective for the amount of clients you're serving. Also, if you want to become a certified AWS Developer or Solutions Architect, this exam would be an easy start to get used to the certification exams!
