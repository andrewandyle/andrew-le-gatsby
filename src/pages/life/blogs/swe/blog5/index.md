1. **What did you do this past week?**

   I met up with my SWE project group and we brainstormed an idea for the project during two Zoom calls. SWE was the primary focus of this week because we needed to submit our idea as quickly as possible.

1. **What's in your way?**

   Last week's craziness is what prevented my group and I from meeting up early, so by the time we brainstormed, a lot of ideas were already taken. We hopped around ideas because we were having trouble making them work (finding the correct APIs or establishing the model connections), and an idea we were going hard on was taken just before we could complete it.

   I also have many things to catch up on in terms of lectures and work, and last week was definitely a hit on my motivation.

1. **What will you do next week?**

   My group and I will meet up so that we can knock out Phase I of the group project. I need to effectively balance my time so I can meet my work deadlines and do good on the algos exam as well.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Single Responsibility Principle?**

   Once again read it last semester from OOP, but I do like this article for clearly explaining the consequences of assigning multiple responsibilities to a class, and how to design classes to separate responsibilities. The challenge is usually identifying these responsibilities, which often happens through frequent testing: if some code gets broken indirectly by a change to some other code, it's a red flag that we might need to follow this principle.

1. **What was your experience of IDB1 and reduce?**

   I think I have a good understanding of the requirements for IDB1, but I'll likely have questions as my group and I go through with the project. I've had to work with reduce in JavaScript, but it was interesting to see how it was implemented in Python by doing the HackerRank exercise.

1. **How did you fare in the storm?**

   My apartment didn't have water, power or heat for most of the week, but luckily I was in West Campus, so I could just walk to campus. I spent the majority of my time in the GDC to use the campus wi-fi and continue working, but my motivation dropped as all due dates got pushed back. I had to survive on all my dry foods, since I wasn't prepared for this situation. I was looking forward to the snow (which I indeed had my fun day on Monday for), but now I know not to underestimate this weather if I see it on the forecast again.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

   I'm eating real food again after stocking up at H-E-B/Costco. Also, the weather at the beginning of this week was perfect for more biking.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   My tip-of-the-week is to learn about promises and async/await if you're not already familiar or proficient with them. Asynchronous calls are an important JavaScript concept, especially when building a web-app that loads data from a backend. I never had direct exposure to it until working at my first job, but my lack of experience with them caused me to fiddle with code a lot without really knowing what I was doing. It would save much more time in development if you look up tutorials and take your time to really understand asynchronous calls.
