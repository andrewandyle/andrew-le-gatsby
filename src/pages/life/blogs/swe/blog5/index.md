1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I used last weekend to go extremely hard on both school and work, before realizing that online classes were cancelled. I wondered why the snow would affect even Zoom classes, until I ended up losing power for days at my apartment. Having nothing to do, I went to campus to get further ahead in all of my classes.

1. **What's in your way?**

    The winter storm was definitely in the way this week. My apartment didn't have power the entire time, forcing me to always go to campus for wifi and electricity. I kept doing my work at the GDC, but sometimes my motivation would fall short, and I felt cold and tired after traveling in the snow.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    The storm probably caused some complications when it came to scheduling meetings for my SWE group. I'll have to put a heavy focus on the SWE group project as well as my algos exam.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?**

    I read it last semester, and my opinions still haven't changed: it's unfortunate that women tend to leave the tech industry, despite their dreams or interests in it, because of both the environment of sexual harrassment and decision-making due to gender bias. I have yet to go to a workplace in-person to see this, so all I can do is read cases about it, but hopefully more work environments by now have measures in place to prevent discrimination.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    The initial snow day was amazing. I was sad that I missed the snow day in Austin last month (San Antonio didn't get snow that day), so I was ecstatic to experience this much snow for the first time, especially with my friends. We went to campus, where everyone was having snowball fights and sledding down hills, and it made me feel like a kid again. That is, until the cruel reality that we were all unprepared for the storm kicked in.

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is to include Redux when creating React apps, especially for this upcoming SWE project. Redux is known for being very compatible with React, because it provides an application state container that allows data access from any component in a React app. I recommend watching tutorials on both React and Redux (specifically from Traversy Media) if you're not very experienced with React. In my first job, the app I worked on used Redux a lot to deal with data from our AWS backend.
