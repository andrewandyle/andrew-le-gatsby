1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I take back everything I said last week about this phase being chill. I got overconfident and we ended up cutting it close, but with two days of going extremely hard on Phase 3, my group and I were able to swiftly get everything done.

2. **What's in your way?**

    While my team is heading in the right direction in terms of initiative and communication, the knowledge and speed gaps still remain. I usually have to answer the majority of my team's questions on the stack or just basic Git stuff. I wanted to leave the harder tasks to them this phase so they would have the chance to take ownership and struggle through the learning process. Once the deadline started closing in though, I had to jump back in to speed up all implementations of filtering/searching/sorting. But at least their effort is more visible.

3. **What will you do next week?**

    I'm unsure what the game plan will be like for Phase 4, since there's no new major additions besides the visualizations and presentation. I'm still going to think of how to approach the final phase of the project with the group to minimize the stress this time.

4. **If you read it, what did you think of the More getters and setters?**

    I haven't had the time to read this week's paper, as my hands are full with Phase 3 and my network security lab due right after.

5. **What was your experience of SQL?**

    I've definitely gained a better understanding of SQL on a low level after this week. It's just a good thing I don't have to memorize the query syntax for any reason. I've only needed to code in SQL for this class and Modern Web Apps, but whenever I work on projects, SQL is always abstracted away from me so I don't have to directly write out queries (especially this project with SQLAlchemy).

6. **What made you happy this week?**

    I've gone 10 days without eating out after stocking up my pantry. I went on a restaurant spree last month to cross a lot of new places off my Austin bucket list, but spent a crazy amount of money in the process, so now I'm exercising some restraint. It's scary how easy it is sometimes to spend money on food without thinking, and then the money spent just piles up later.

7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is something that Downing already posted about on Piazza a while ago: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). I never knew about it until he brought it up, but it's a really great software used for workspaces, note-taking, reminders, and more. I switched over to using Notion for personal use, as I maintain my agenda on there instead of Google Keep now. It's easy to use, has many templates, and has a lot of potential for team workspaces as well!
