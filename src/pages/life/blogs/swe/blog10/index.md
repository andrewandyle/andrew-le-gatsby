1. **What did you do this past week?**

    Over the weekend, despite how tired I already was, I made one final push to complete the requirements for Phase 2 with my team. I also wrote a ton on my peer reviews and began putting serious effort into improvement for all of my team. We've already started preparing for Phase 3, creating our user stories early, increasing communcation, and delegating tasks immediately. Phase 2 was a NIGHTMARE and we will not go through the same thing again in Phase 3.

1. **What's in your way?**

    I'm so tired. Both my physical and mental condition felt depleted by the end of Phase 2. I never expected this project to make me feel so terrible. But I will do everything I can to make sure things do get better and this never happens again.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I have an algos exam on Monday, so immediately after that is when I plan on beginning my commits to Phase 3. In the meantime, I will monitor what the team is doing and communicate with them a lot to ensure they get caught up in commits and they're not stuck. Also, getting my vaccine from UT on Tuesday, so I'm not sure how that experience will be yet.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of the Dependency Inversion Principle?**

    This reading clearly explained the criteria that developers normally follow when preventing bad software design, and what properties exactly entail bad design. I liked how thorough this reading was and that it had great examples to prove their points. This principle also ties back to the other principles that we learned in the past papers.

1. **What was your experience of functions?**

    I'm slipping behind, not really being able to do well on the quizzes or exercises (couldn't figure this week's HackerRank out). I need to set aside some time to focus on the class materials instead of the project.
    
    Some things in the function lectures were familiar, but I also learned some new Python tricks. I'm interested in seeing what kind of code designs can take advantage of iterable unpacking. The examples in class went over unpacking from and into iterables, but I didn't know how to apply unpacking to class attributes (like in this week's HackerRank).

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I've returned to being a human being this week. Sufficient sleep and cooking for myself again has never felt any better. Also, because I think I deserve a break (because I never went on vacation in over a year due to work + COVID), I reserved an Airbnb at Dallas on a whim and will drive up and explore there the entire weekend!

1. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My pick-of-the-week is something that I found because I happened to read one of Kent Hansen's [blogs](https://kenthansen98.medium.com/cs-373-spring-2021-kent-hansen-4-2d1f326ba385): an online course/resource for full stack development called [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). It has a lot of explanations and exercises which go over essential full stack tools like React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and GraphQL. It teaches you how to build a full stack app using a REST API, but using different tools from our project requirements. If you found yourself struggling to pick up on this project, I recommend you read through these if you want to improve your skills after this class!
