1. **What did you do this past week?**

    Since I'm eager to finish the project, and there isn't much coding-wise in Phase 4, I set aside 10 hours immediately after the Phase 3 deadline to wrap up the remaining user stories, then create all visualizations for our data and our provider's data. I'm completely done with code for this project, until we get feedback from the graders. So I used most of this week to prepare for the presentation.

2. **What's in your way?**

    I'm definitely feeling the impact of the last few months of constant grinding. When it came to my full stack job, I would push hard on completing tasks on top of schoolwork, as well as use my winter and spring breaks as a chance to grind even more. If I was feeling physically or mentally tired, I would ignore it. Now I'm starting to feel a lack of motivation close to the end of the semester, where I just want to swiftly complete everything and get them over with. This project definitely accelerated my exhaustion as well.

3. **What will you do next week?**

    The endgame for my semester is two video presentations (SWE and western music) and two exams (algos and network security), so by completing the videos first, I can reduce my overall workload to the two exams. Next week I will start putting a heavier focus on the exams, but hopefully by this weekend I'm close enough on finishing my videos so I can relax on those classes.

4. **If you read it, what did you think of What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You?**

    I remember reading this paper last semester in OOP. Raising community awareness regarding ethical and behavioral issues in the workplace is important, as more companies over time can take action against these issues and create a better environment for their workers.

5. **What was your experience of joins and refactoring?**

    SQL joins were a bit difficult for me to get used to in a short amount of time when driving for that HackerRank. Refactoring seems straightforward so far, I'm guessing we'll be learning even more about that next week, but we won't learn about that or design as much as intended due to the snowstorm.

6. **What made you happy this week?**

    I got to register for my classes early, since I'm currently 96% complete and graduating next fall. I only had two CS classes to go, so that's all I needed to register for. Hoping for a laid-back semester (and back in-person!) after two brutal online semesters.

7. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is to use [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US) to create your Phase 4 visualizations if you haven't already done them yet. This library allows you to use their React components to create D3 charts under the hood, rather than needing to do the JavaScript code from scratch. All you have to worry about is filtering your data based on what you want to visualize, then pass it in! There are many helpful examples from both this library's documentation as well as last semester's repos.
