1. **What did you do this past week?**

    I worked every day for 2 hours with my partner on the Voting project. We already passed all the test cases post-optimization, so we just have to get the acceptance and unit tests in before we’re done!

    I also went to the Career Fair, but was disappointed in how much harder the recruitment process is, with the lack of 1-on-1s for some companies (and the usual technical difficulties that some recruiters had). The FoCS brunch was also a bad experience due to the lack of organization (queuing in line to talk to companies), and I literally only got into 3 meetings with 2 companies total. Unsurprisingly, those 2 companies are the ones that I had referrals in, and that I’m moving forward with in the application process. As of now, I seem to only have a chance with companies in which I have connections.

1. **What’s in your way?**

    I have to juggle work, school, and my interviews all at once. I have a deadline for an app release on the next Thursday, so I’m facing pressure there. Fortunately, the Voting project is being wrapped up, so my struggles in this class will be relieved for a little while.

1. **What will you do next week?**

    I will finish up the Voting project with my partner, hopefully in one session, and keep up with the lecture content while dealing with both of my interviews and work next week.

1. **What was your experience of values, addresses, references and consts?**

    Even though all of these concepts should have been familiar in 429 and 439, I wasn’t quite the best with pointer/address logic when working on the projects. I would easily get tripped up, misinterpret questions, and cause debugging sessions in my OS groups just because of a simple misuse. I definitely think that the way to getting comfortable about addresses and references would be to write small programs. The Voting project is already helping with that, as me and my partner have both thought about when to use addresses and references in our solution.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

    I’m happy that I moved on to the interview process for two companies. Usually the Career Fair would end in failure, either getting instantly rejected or not hearing back from any of the companies. Though the two interviews that I got are really from referrals, I’m grateful to my friends for getting my name through to their connections and giving me more shots at a better internship.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

    My tip-of-the-week is (and I can’t stress this enough since I’ve said it in the rest of the blog post) to leverage any connections that you have. That is one of the best chances some people might have if they’re still looking for an internship. Networking has become much harder without in-person opportunities. You can’t see companies table at the atrium anymore or talk to recruiters after FoCS events, and it was hard to get anywhere in the Career Fair when some companies only offered group sessions.
