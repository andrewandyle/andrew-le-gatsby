1. **What did you do this past week?**

   No time spent on the Voting project, it was already finished! My partner and I went about it very efficiently, knocking it out in exactly a week. It was probably the best pair experience I’ve had, no exaggeration. So, I was able to spend a lot of time this week on the lectures instead.

1. **What’s in your way?**

   I got sick for the first two days this week. My migraines would get really intense after just staring at a live Zoom session, usually for around 20 minutes. I still feel like my actual learning only happens when I watch the Zoom lecture recordings. Self-paced watching feels better than requiring sharp attention on the live lecture, I can take breaks to not burn out too.

   My screen time has been insane lately, at least 12 hours a day. It’s really hard to reduce that screen time without falling behind.

1. **What will you do next week?**

   I will start the Allocator project with my partner, so hoping we can keep a relatively good pace on it.

   I normally strictly schedule all my days in blocks, so I can reach every class and get progress done in both of my jobs. Seeing how that’s not working out and my productivity has decreased, I’m going to go for a looser structure and start enjoying the fresh air randomly on weekdays, even if it means slightly falling behind. No point in caring about only efficiency if it’s going to decrease anyway.

1. **If you read it, what did you think of Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?**

   I have not had exposure to how discriminatory the technical workplace is against women, so it’s a bit surprising and unfortunate that women still have to deal with such an environment, and that they have to leave the field regardless of their interest in the industry and their roles. I found the sections about unconscious-bias training and efforts to prevent acting on that bias to be interesting.

1. **What was your experience of arrays, equal(), and iterators?**

   Everything this week besides the arrays content felt new, so I had to take my time to absorb it all. I definitely have to make sure I don’t get confused with referencing arrays. equal() was new because it was different from using Java’s equals(), as you had to specify how long of a section you’re checking for equality. Iterators felt somewhat familiar, but I don’t remember too much from using iterators in Java.

1. **What made you happy this week?**

   After a tough week with interviews and work, I took my bike on Saturday evening and went alone to Zilker Park. I passed by the bridge and stayed at Zilker to see the sunset, then I went back to the Congress Bridge to see downtown lit up.

1. **What’s your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

   My pick-of-the-week is ZenHub for project teams following an Agile workflow. I used ZenHub for the entirety of one of my internships, and it was really useful to keep our tasks organized, and size and prioritize them. Every sprint session we had started with a meeting to discuss new issues and prioritize them on ZenHub. ZenHub has a lot of useful features, such as categorizing tasks in Epics and viewing a roadmap with the Epics, and viewing a burndown report to track the team’s overall progress on a sprint.
